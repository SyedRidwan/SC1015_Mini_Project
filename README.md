# SC1015_Mini_Project
Mini project for SC1015, focusing on the impact of the government on Human Freedom Index


## Human Freedom Index Analysis
This project analyzes the impact of governance, economic policies, and legal frameworks on human freedom across different countries. By forecasting human freedom index (HFI) using the top 5 most significant variables, the project highlights the critical role these factors play in shaping HFI over the years.

## Problem definition:
How might the effectiveness of a government impact future levels of human freedom
\n What can be done to improve future levels of human freedom?

## Model used:
Linear regression

## Key Findings
Top Countries: High human freedom scores are associated with policies prioritizing economic freedom, regulatory efficiency, and civil liberties, leading to robust socio-economic outcomes.
Bottom Countries: Lower human freedom scores are often linked to challenges in governance effectiveness, regulatory burdens, and political rights, which hinder progress.

## Recommendations for Improvement
Promote Economic Freedom: Reduce regulatory barriers and safeguard property rights to foster innovation and entrepreneurship.
Strengthen Democratic Institutions: Invest in transparent governance, electoral processes, and rule of law to bolster political freedoms.
Advance Social Justice: Implement equitable policies addressing poverty, inequality, and social exclusion to promote a more inclusive society.
Protect Civil Liberties: Safeguard rights such as freedom of expression, assembly, and association to nurture democratic culture and pluralism.
